# Final-Project
Hello, Welcome to my Final Project.
My project consist of a Character Creation program and three Mini Adventure Storys.
This program allows you to create a character and to battle your character against bosses in 3 mini adeventure stories.

Please reall all directions carefully!

Character Creation Involves making a Character of your Choose
Character Creation program will allow pick options and make a toon based on your inputs
Please type in answers extactly as I ask them EXAMPLE;
What race do you want to be?
Orc, Night Elf, Human
Type "Orc" not orc or OrC

The way I set up my final project for you to enjoy is as follows:

First open: ToonCreator.py
--This will allow you to make a character--

After your character is created you may choose one of the boss fight python files to run:
-- Open BossFight1.py--
-- Open BossFight2.py--
-- Open BossFight3.py--

You can run through all three our just one. I wanted to create a function to run the three boss fights from the
toon creator file but I wasn't able to figure out the function.

**More details**
CharacterInfo.py is linked to the toon creator program to act as an 'save' file.
This file basically will save all of the user inputs from ToonCreator.py.
I made this file to allow user inputs to be used inside of the BossFights.

bossfightfunctions.py holds all of the functions I put into the boss fights.
I bsically made every option in the boss fight a fucntion with shared variables to make a little less work
Im not sure if the file is actually neccsary, I could I have just put all the info I need into the bossfight files
but my brain understood it this way better.

Randomnamepicker.py is my file that will allow you to either pick a random name in the ToonCreator file or choose your own.
